        <div class = "box">
            I am Jacob Atwood. I am currently in 
            my first year at Washington State University 
            majoring in Computer Science. I have experience
            C and C++ in my schooling. My current interests and 
            personal studies include working with game design in Unity along with C#.
            I am also working on this website. My hopes are to use this website to help
            learn and understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, pushing forward into using
            the react framework.
